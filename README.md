# Background
InstaPlaces, a clone of Instagram application, a photo sharing application where users can also search and follow other users, and comment and like other user’s posts. 

# Technologies:

* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* SCSS
* React
* Redux
* AWS S3
* Heroku

# Features
Secure user authentication using BCrypt. A demo user was created for anyone who wants to take a peek of what the app can do.

### CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Cycle
Users can post a new photo with a caption and later on can edit that caption and they can also delete their own post and comments on their own post and on other user’s post. AWS S3 is being used to saved the posts.

### Search bar
Implemented a search bar to search for other users to follow. Results are based on users input.
